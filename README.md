# JoystickCounter

Designed a digital circuit and programmed a microcontroller to function as an up-down counter using a seven-segment display.

Implemented logic to increment and decrement hexadecimal values (0â€“9) stored in an array, triggering corresponding cathode segments to illuminate. 

Utilized the onboard joystick to control the counter direction in real time.
